9.  cd ~     ---> Go back to home directory. 

10. Relative Path :-  cd Desktop/Delta 
    ---> Relative Paths start with a folder_name, and depend upon current  working directory.
    ---> Means if you are at current working directory then using relative path you can only navigate to the directories,
         which are inside current working directory. 

11. Absolute Path :- /users/ashokkaji/Codes/C 
---> Absolute path starts with / (forward slash).
---> And don’t depend upon current working directory. you can navigate to any directory from any anywhere using absolute path.

12.  / (forward slash) :- it indicates Root directory . computer ki sari chije root directory me hoti h, including multiple profiles.

13. ~ (tilt) :- it indicates Home directory. kisi particular profile ki sari files and folders home directory me  rahti hai.

14. mkdir (make directory)  ---> it will create a directory,  which is not already existed.

15. mkdir using relative path = mkdir Codes/C/hello

16. mkdir /users/ashokkaji/Codes/C/hello2  ---> create directory using absolute path. 

17. Files or folders which start with dot(.) is hidden and not visible to a normal users.

18. Flags :- Flags are characters which added with commands to get extra iformantion. Ex:- ls -a, ls -l etc.

28. rmdir (Remove directory)   ---> it will remove empty directory only.

29. rm -rf (recursive force)  ---> removes any folder = r(recursive delete), f(forced delete). = combined flags
